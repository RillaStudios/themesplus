///
/// ### Notes:
///
/// - Ensure you have the ThemesPlus package imported in your pubspec.yaml file.
/// - Ensure you use the [ThemesUtil.init] method in the main method to initialize the themes.
/// - Ensure you convert the main method to an async method using the `async` keyword.
/// - Ensure you await the [ThemesUtil.init] method.
/// - Ensure that method [WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized] is called before the [ThemesUtil.init] method.
///
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  await ThemesUtil.init(
    /// A list of all the themes for the app.
    ///
    /// This list cannot be empty. Every theme must have a unique name and id.
    /// The first theme in the list is set as the current theme (default).
    ///
    /// The current theme can be accessed using [ThemesUtil.currentTheme].
